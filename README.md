specific knowledge needed.

## Install

You can bring up and running the project using this command.
This command will prepare the development environment for you
to do your work.

make sure that everything is okay, it will run the application tests.

```shell
make install
```

itself like lunching with a specific user you can 
use this command like this.

```shell
make up up-as="--user root"
```

Currently, the project brings up the environment on
detach mode, but you can change it, for example you
may want to remove orphan containers too, like bellow.
